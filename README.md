* Smooth Gui backport.
* Minecraft-CameraOverhaul backport.

* Some features backported from modern Shoulder Surfing (meant to be used along the `1.7.10` Shoulder Surfing, but should also work on their own):

  * Switch to first person when certain items are held, or some actions made (like bow shooting), configurable
  * Player model fading if the camera gets too close
  * Omnidirectional sprinting
* Camera follow lag in Shoulder Surfing mode
